# Computer Architecture Simulation Project

## Overview

This project is a computer architecture simulation in **Java** that emulates the behavior of a simple processor. The simulation includes components such as a processor, datapath, register file, and a parser. The primary goal of this project is to provide a hands-on experience with computer architecture concepts and enable users to understand the fundamental operations of a basic processor.

## Features

- **Processor:** The central processing unit (CPU) of the simulated architecture. It executes instructions and manages the flow of data between various components.

- **Datapath:** Represents the dataflow within the processor. It includes various functional units responsible for performing arithmetic and logic operations.

- **Register File:** A set of registers that store intermediate data during the execution of instructions. The register file is an integral part of the processor's architecture.

- **Parser:** Parses instructions to convert them into a format that the processor can understand and execute. It interprets the assembly-like language used in the simulation.
